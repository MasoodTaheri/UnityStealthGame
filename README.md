Simple 3D AI for a Stealth Game

Masood Taheri



The AI system is based on the Finite State Machine Architecture(FSM). There are some different states that have different behavior and based on their decision, we can go to the other state.
There is a specific class name “State Machine Controller”. Its duty is to handle the states. by defining a variable of “State Machine Controller” you can have access to states and change them.
